## About me

I am a senior at NWMSU double majoring in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I am an international student from Ukraine. I love travelling, playing tennis, and watching "Try Not to Laugh Challenges". I think I can be pretty good at them if I try - but more often then not I just watch them with a purpose of laughing.

I love travelling by train - this picture is something I've always wanted to do in real life. Maybe one day, who knows - so far my travels by train have been pretty boring.
